v1.4.2 - Jul 26, 2012
* Merged support for MCBans 3.8 from @syamn (thanks!). Please note this version will NOT work with version 3.7, stay on Honeypot 1.4.1 until you update to MCBans 3.8. This is UNTESTED by me, I'm simply taking the merge request on faith that it was tested to work. Please report back if you have issues.

v1.4.1 - Jun 30, 2012
* Ticket #12: fixed bug preventing rollback from working on shutdown
* Ticket #9: fixed NPE bug (no line numbers in stack trace to be sure, but hopefully I found and fixed it)
* added block material detail to honeypot.log for points feature, so it's easy to see what they were breaking

v1.4 - Jun 23, 2012
* updated build system to maven (easier for others to contribute)
* minor code cleanup (MCBans2 no longer supported)
* built against latest Bukkit RB 1.2.5-R4.0
* debug symbols turned on for better stack traces

v1.3 - Mar 3, 2012
* merged dogbig's pull request for Ultraban support

v1.2 - Feb 18, 2012
* updated to latest Bukkit-1.1-R4 (RB #1938)
* updated to new style Bukkit configuration
* updated to new Bukkit event system
* updated to modern Permission system, borrowed from my HSP plugin. Leverages
Vault, WorldEdit, superperms, etc. It works out of the box, but if you want to
do configuration as an admin, see documentation: http://goo.gl/TErPh
* code cleanup: removed all System.out calls in favor of log.info

v1.1 - Dec 3, 2011
- added support for "/hp region" to record a WE region as a Honeypot. This
is NOT intended as a WorldGuard replacement, use sparingly and intelligently.

v1.0.3 - Nov 2, 2011
- added support for "globalBan: true" option in config.yml to support McBans3
automatic global bans - note this is ONLY supported for config.yml and
McBans3 (don't try with old-style honeypot.properties or McBans2)

v1.0.2 - Oct 30, 2011
- added support for latest CB (#1368+)

v1.0.1 - Sept 10, 2011
- fixed MCBans3 support to report finding it correctly (it was finding and
using it before, but was falsely reporting Vanilla on startup)

v1.0 - Sept 5, 2011
- initial (untested) MCBans3 support
- added a timer related to the "offenseCount" code - if offenseCount is > 1
and someone trips a Honeypot block but doesn't exceed the offenseCount, the
code will reset the broken Honeypot blocks within 5 minutes of that player
logging out.
- added support for standard Bukkit config.yml file. If you have an existing
old-style .properties file, Honeypot will still use that. If you don't, it
will create and prefer a new-style Bukkit config.yml instead.
- added support for "ban points", an advanced form of the offenseCount
algorithm. Read documentation for more details. This feature is ONLY supported
in new config.yml config syntax.
- version bump to 1.0 since there were some major new features to justify more
than a minor version bump and I think this plugin has been around and in use
long enough to qualify for a non-beta version number

v0.9 - Sept 4, 2011
- removed support for SimpleBans
- added support for KiwiAdmin plugin
- changed the behaviour when player got kicked using EasyBan method (not banned)
- source code format and cleanup

v0.8 - Sept 3, 2011
- Added an "offenseCount" parameter, which defines the number of Honeypot
offenses before action is taken.  When action is taken, the Honeypot blocks
that were broken are automatically rolled back. Defaults to 1, which is the
previous default behavior (one block break = immediate action).

v0.7.2 - Sept 2, 2011
- added support for vanilla and EasyBan
- added 'honeypotBanReason' config option (ban reason for EB and MCBANS), defaults to "Destroyed honeypot block."
- added 'kickBanSender' config option (who banning, kicking - only MCBANS), defaults to "[Honeypot]"
- added 'doLoc' config option (location of player into ban reason, all ban systems), defaults to "false"
- code cleanup

v0.7.1 - July 3, 2011
- added 'logpath' config option, defaults to "plugins/Honeypot/honeypot.log"

v0.7
- fixed bug on saving that caused data file to be wiped out
- made multiworld compatible
- performance improvements, since this is called on every block break and
was previously not very efficient for a large number of Honeypot blocks
- added ant build script for building jar

v6
- last release by @aArgomirr
